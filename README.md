# sentiment-analysis
the project can be used to predict the sentiment of the line written by the user(about a movie in this case)

    there are 2 files 
        1. sentiment analysis.py dataset is raw and downloaded from the internet but as the size of the dataset is large i am
          not able to upload itin this repository.
         
        2. sentiment analysis using dataset keras.py as the name suggests the dataset used in this file is downloaded from 
          keras and is pre-processed. accuracy of this file was 87.2%
          
# dependencies used 
     
     1. numpy 
     2. keras
     3. sklearn
     
        
the file sentiment analysis.py is not well evaluated due to lack of computational power.but worked well with examples i used.
